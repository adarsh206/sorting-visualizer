# Sorting Visualizer:

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:


                     1. Bubble sort
                     2. Selection sort
                     3. Insertion sort
                     4. Merge sort
                     5. Quick sort
                     6. Heap sort
